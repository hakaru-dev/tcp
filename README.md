# Hakaru Team Challenge Problem

## Installing

The `tcp` repository includes the main `hakaru` repository as a submodule, so cloning requires an additional `--recursive` switch. (see [Git-SCM](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for details)

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/hakaru-dev/tcp
```
